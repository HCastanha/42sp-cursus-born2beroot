	As part of the challenge of setting up a functional server, I chose for this project to work with CentOS.
</p>
<p align=center>
    CentOS (Community Enterprise Operating System) is a free, open source GNU/Linux distribution. It is functionally compatible and derived from RHEL(Red Hat Enterprise Linux), its subscription-paid twin.
</p>
<p align=center>
    The choice for CentOS comes from a very practical and straightforward curiosity: it is Enterprise-focused and one of the most popular distros used for large-scale and modern business environments.
</p>
<p align=center>
    Even though CentOS was, as of this year, discontinued for new releases and support from December 2021, RHEL is still largely used in many environments, and will most likely continue to be so for the nearby future. CentOS and RHEL, being virtually the same system, require the same basic knowledge to be set, turning a CentOS project still of great value.
</p>
<p align=center>
    Apart from that, CentOS is a very stable OS, receiving very few and largely sparse upgrades, which turns it into the most likely system to be used as server in the real world. It was made for Enterprises, and for the purpose of this project, just makes more sense.
